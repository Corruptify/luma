<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Why make Luma? Coolmathgames is better??

There are many great game websites on the interwebs but I never really saw one that suited my needs.

* Most websites had too many broken games. I couldn't pick a game! By the time I did It would either be blocked or my lunch period would be over.
* I realized there are many gems on the internet but most game websites are filled with crappy, and unneeded games.

I do realize that people's purposes may be different, and that's great! there are many great game websites out there like CoolMathGames, Geometry Spot, Lioxyrt, etc.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Features

Chat! Chat with your friends.

Themes! Change the color of the page to your liking

![themes](https://github.com/Corruptify/luma/assets/88192394/63d46050-6a17-4089-befc-e033e27c8541)

Panic Button! If you have someone walking up to your computer and you need to get off what you are on (you know who you are) you can simply press ` and abort to a link of your choosing. This option is in settings.

Tab cloak! If your school uses programs like goguardian or linewize you may find this feature useful. Simply click one of the buttons to change the name of the website. This is useful as programs like GoGuardian and Linewise show the icon of the website, alerting teachers if there is a game website they recognize. Using tab cloak they will simply see the icon you chose and think it is just another school-related tab.
